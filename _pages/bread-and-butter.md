*Dearest friend,*

*Crawl on out of your design cave, because you are cordially invited to Bread & Butter, an art and design social hour hosted by KB+BA at ADX, 417 SE 11th Ave, Portland, OR, where you can indulge Brendan's desire to bake more bread than he can eat. See below for dates and times!*

*Yours, etc.,*

*Kate and Brendan*
