Magic Circle is Kate Barbaria and Brendan Albano, artists and architects based in Portland, OR. Our practice is rooted in performance, storytelling and space-making. We invite our audiences to join us in ritual and play, to be transported to other worlds, and to discover delight in the everyday magic of this one.

# Projects

*Tell Me Something You’ve Been Thinking About* is an interactive performance where we collect conversations with participants about things they have been thinking about. The potentially wide-ranging topics form a portrait of a group of people at a particular time and place. We've performed *Tell Me Something You’ve Been Thinking About* at Form.a at Oregon Contemporary on July 1st, 2023 and at the 2023 Oregon Country Fair.
