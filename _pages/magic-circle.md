Magic Circle is Kate Barbaria and Brendan Albano, artists and architects based in Portland, OR. Our practice is rooted in performance, storytelling and space-making. We invite our audiences to join us in ritual and play, to be transported to other worlds, and to discover delight in the everyday magic of this one.

## Word Wizards, 2024

Word Wizards is a role-playing game (RPG) about a group of wizards who have just discovered wizarding and are rapidly and chaotically expanding their understanding of true words of magic. These stories can play out in a variety of settings and genres. Think stories about children going to wizard school, ill-advised deals with devils and faeries, government experiments with psychedelics, or anything else that sparks your imagination!

## Being Present Is Hard To Do, 2023, 2012

Performers prepare extensively for their performances, yet audience members rarely do. *Being Present Is Hard To Do* explores how an audience might prepare for a show with the same intensity that a performer does. The piece is reimagined for each audience. Performed at *Something Weird* in Portland in 2023 and the *New Blood VI Performance Festival* in Chicago in 2012.

## Tell Me Something You've Been Thinking About, 2023

*Tell Me Something You’ve Been Thinking About* is an interactive performance where we collect conversations with participants about things they have been thinking about. The potentially wide-ranging topics form a portrait of a group of people at a particular time and place. We've performed *Tell Me Something You’ve Been Thinking About* at Form.a at Oregon Contemporary on July 1st, 2023 and at the 2023 Oregon Country Fair.

## Mr. Boat-head’s Electrical Dreamship / Casual Stories Project, 2011

"In this groovy, unpretentious little show, Brendan Albano and Kate Barbaria invite tiny audiences—the max is eight people—to sit around a warmly glowing lamp underneath a tarp and drink tea or cocoa. They also give audience members 30 seconds to think of four kinds of material to share: a story, a dream, a lie, and a poem. Our lives and subconscious minds are all treasure troves... Intimate and elemental. I totally dug it." - Collin Thomas, *The Georgia Straight*
