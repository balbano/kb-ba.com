Forest Grove, Oregon<br>
New home in a co-housing community

The [Green Grove Cohousing Community](https://greengrovecoho.org/) is a 5-acre property with 9 homes, in Forest Grove, Oregon. The collective and the individuals that live there embrace “environmental sustainability, social justice, community service and the arts”.

The challenge was to design three compact homes with smart, cost-effective strategies for sustainability, while celebrating the landscape with simple and beautiful buildings.

When you live on a farm and have kids, you’re going to need a mudroom. And some extra outdoor space to burn off excess energy. And storage in every nook and cranny. And a space of your own. The Green Grove Story and a Half fits a lot into a compact package, while still making space to celebrate the simple things, like a feature stair with a playful storage element, and not one, but two porches. The bedrooms on the second floor are carefully arranged in the half-story space with dormers, in order to fit in with the smaller homes in the community.
