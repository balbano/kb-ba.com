Victorian house renovation<br>

This 1901 Victorian house was delectably derelict, with a crumbling brick foundation, deficient structure, cramped rooms, and irreplaceable historic charm. A complete foundation replacement and expansion that involved lifting the house was in order, followed by structural improvements integrated into the existing historic balloon framing. The interior spaces have been opened up for more modern living, and a new kitchen is the cherry on top.
