Attached ADU and outdoor area 

The Visitor’s Retreat is a small guest suite/accessory dwelling unit, converted from an unused enclosed porch on the lower story of a mid-century modern home. 

As the owners’ travel less than they used to, they wanted to create a guest suite with a magnetic hospitality that would draw their friends and family to them. The Retreat’s simple spaces are designed with relaxation and accessibility in mind. In the rear of the space, a secluded bathing and sauna complex is ensconced in cool green light from mature bamboo in the yard.
