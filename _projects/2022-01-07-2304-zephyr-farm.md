Gales Creek, Oregon<br>
Phased co-housing on an organic farm

The new farmhouse at Zephyr Farm is a tranquil retreat from the work of the farm and a hub for the broader farm community. In its first phase, the residents will be the clients and their two children, while the kitchen and dining room will serve weekly farm dinners for up to 12. Over time, a series of additions will expand the home to support three separate families living together under one roof.
