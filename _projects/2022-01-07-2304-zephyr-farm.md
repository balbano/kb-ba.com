Gales Creek, Oregon<br>
Phased co-housing on an organic farm

In its first phase, the new farmhouse on Zephyr Farm will be home to the clients and their children, and serve as a tranquil retreat from the work of the farm. In the long term, a series of additions will eventually be home to three separate families living together. In the meantime, the kitchen and dining room serve weekly farm family dinners for up to 12.
