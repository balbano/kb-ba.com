The [Green Grove Cohousing Community](https://greengrovecoho.org/) is a 5-acre property with 9 homes, in Forest Grove, Oregon. The collective and the individuals that live there embrace “environmental sustainability, social justice, community service and the arts”.

The challenge was to design three compact homes with smart, cost-effective strategies for sustainability, while celebrating the landscape with simple and beautiful buildings.

The Green Grove Hillside House is a home for two professionals who work from home. To provide decompression and a space to switch “off”, the open living space is divided into a screen-free living room/library on one side, and a work area on the other. Windows look out over the pastoral countryside. The second bedroom doubles as another home office, providing acoustic separation from the main living space.
