Portland, Oregon<br>
The highest form of art is drinking beer with friends. And watching sports. Lots of sports.

Two die hard sports fanatics needed a dedicated space to watch the game multiple nights a week, host their friends, eat pizza, and drink Miller Lite. Enter the Party Shed — a high-class, low-brow, all-season, indoor-outdoor super-compact cozy-luxe backyard bar dedicated to the art of living and breathing sports. The space is built around a bar and sofa stacked together, providing direct viewing angles for 7-8 people. The structure also has just enough room for the other essentials of sports-viewing: spilling beer, dropping a slice on the floor with no consequences, and pacing. Lots of pacing.
