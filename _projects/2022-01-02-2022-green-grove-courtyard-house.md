Forest Grove, Oregon<br>
New home in a co-housing community

The [Green Grove Cohousing Community](https://greengrovecoho.org/) is a 5-acre property with 9 homes, in Forest Grove, Oregon. The collective and the individuals that live there embrace “environmental sustainability, social justice, community service and the arts”.

The challenge was to design three compact homes with smart, cost-effective strategies for sustainability, while celebrating the landscape with simple and beautiful buildings.

The Green Grove Courtyard House has a secret – a small courtyard is nestled at the heart of the house with a hot tub situated perfectly for stargazing. An open plan and daylight from multiple directions makes the space calm and spacious in spite of its compact and efficient layout.
