Portland, Oregon<br>
Age-in-place living combined with a shared family art studio and ADU above

Nestled into the dense fabric of Portland’s east side, an awkwardly shaped lot with a derelict garage is transformed into a tender multi-generational complex. A light-filled, age-in-place home fills the first floor of the main building, and a sweet and cozy ADU is nestled on top. A detached art studio for the family and neighbors, plus some hearty bike storage, are tucked into the rear garden. 

This age-in-place home prioritizes light, community connection, and views of good green things. A playful, romantic herb garden out front serves dual purposes as a social connector and privacy buffer for residents, while the rear sunroom provides solitude and connection to the outdoors during Portland’s watery winter days.
